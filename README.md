# Always Forward

## A Planner For Your Entire Life

### The Plan
I believe I have tried every iteration of time management tool and have never been perfectly satisfied with any of them at scale. I think Toggl has the best time manager for hourly time management but I have never been satisfied with any of the bigger picture time planners. 

This is my attempt to solve that problem for myself, and maybe yours too.

### The Philosophy
This planner and task organizer is the conclusion of the following thought-process:

1. You should constantly remember you are going to die.
2. How can I know exactly how much time I have left and be able to budget it accordingly?
3. A human lifespan can be broken down into just under 5000 weeks.
4. Each week can receive a kanban board, and I can apply some of the same principles in business time management with life management.

## Your Life in Weeks
I have one of these "Your Life in Weeks" posters hanging in my room, and I always liked the idea. I tried integrating the already built [React Life Calendar](https://github.com/ngduc/life-calendar), but I decided to write my own so I didn't have to use the chakra libraries used in that project. I think what I came up with was far simpler. Mine only uses Tailwind, and is only 2 jsx files with a css stylesheet. I am thinking about making that its own repo. 

### Other Considerations
- Integrations with Toggl, which I like for hourly time management.
